# ML-Algorithms
My own implementations of various machine learning algorithms

### Idea

This repo will display my implementations of various machine learning algorithms mostly in Python or R. There will be a directory
for each algorithm that I implement.

### Purpose

The purpose is to learn to understand ML algorithms better. Many see ML algorithms as a black box, therefore, it is important to
build your own to understand them at a deeper level. I often find myself using libraries such as scikit-learn, tensorflow, or mlbench
to use ML in applications without actually understanding how they work. This project attempts to fix that issue.

### Algorithms

Next Algorithms to implements:
* Linear Regression
* Logistic regression
* Decision Tree
